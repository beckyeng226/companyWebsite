        <h3>Most of our products are custom-designed for the individual needs of the users.  Because our products are meant to help individuals live more independently
        within their environments, we consult with all stakeholders, including family, caretakers, educators, therapists, and employers, to identify what needs the app 
        will address and how to best accomplish that for the users.<br/>
